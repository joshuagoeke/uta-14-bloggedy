## Description

This was one of my first full-stack projects and I learned a lot about the way MySQL works through modularized javascript files to display data to the front end. It was also one of my first uses of a Model-View-Controller. I utilized [handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render templates with the blog data stored in the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database. 

For my purposes, I found it expendient to re-factor code provided by the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp from an in-class fundraising app mini-project rather than starting from scratch. By re-factoring the code I was able to more quickly get to a minimum-viable-product. At a later date, I plan to come back and add more comments, and clean up the code to make it more readable.
